1. Research AWS cost-saving tools such as Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and Spot Instances. Provide a summary to compare these options and explain their use cases and benefits.

AWS offers several cost-saving options to help optimize cloud spending based on workload patterns and flexibility.

Reserved Instances (RIs) provide significant discounts—up to 75% compared to on-demand pricing—in exchange for committing to use specific instance types in a particular region for a 1- or 3-year term. RIs are ideal for steady-state, predictable workloads such as databases or backend services that run continuously. They come in two main types: Standard RIs (highest discount, less flexible) and Convertible RIs (slightly lower discount, allow instance type modifications).

Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offers discounts similar to RIs but with more adaptability. There are two types: Compute Savings Plans, which apply to any EC2 instance regardless of region, family, or OS, and EC2 Instance Savings Plans, which offer slightly higher discounts but restrict you to a specific instance family in a region. Savings Plans suit organizations seeking cost savings with less rigid commitments than RIs, allowing easier adaptation to changing infrastructure needs.

Spot Instances offer the deepest discounts—up to 90% off on-demand prices—by utilizing spare AWS capacity. However, they can be interrupted with little notice if AWS needs the capacity back. Spot Instances are best suited for flexible, fault-tolerant workloads such as batch processing, big data analysis, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable containerized applications that can handle interruptions and resume processing later.

In summary, Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are optimal for predictable, continuous usage, providing cost certainty and savings. In contrast, Spot Instances are cost-effective for flexible workloads that tolerate interruptions. Combining these options strategically can maximize cost efficiency across diverse workload types.
